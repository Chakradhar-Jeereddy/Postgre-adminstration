pg_ctl can be used to start, stop and promote/failover a standby database to primary. (Note: Standby can accept only reads in PG)

# Startup commands
  pg_ctl -D $PGDATA start  #Unlike oracle, no muliple startup modes in postgresql
  pg_ctl -D $PGDATA status

A cluster is started using one data directory and a port on just one host.

# Shutdown modes - default is smart
  Smart - It waits for the existing connections to disconnect, new ones will not be allowed
  Fast  - It will kill existing connections and does checkpoint and rollback to avoid crash recovery during next startup, this mode is widely used in pord
  Immediate - This is simliar to shut abort in oracle, which explains the behaviour.
  we use -m flag to specify the mode of shutdown
  
  pg_ctl -D $PGDATA stop -ms
  pg_ctl -D $PGDATA stop -mf
  pg_ctl -D $PGDATA stop -mi
  
- Note - never use kill command to stop the cluster.
  
# Ways to find data directory
  if the cluster is running
  ps -ef|grep /post   
  ps -ef|grep postgres
  if the cluster is not running
  locate postgresql.auto.conf   - postgrsql.auto.conf can't be stored in different location other than data directory
